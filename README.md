## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine with this command:

```sh
https://github.com/GaneshNune/Heart-disease-classification-using-ML.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Go to the project directory and install the required dependencies. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

```sh
cd Heart-Disease-Classification-using-ML
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Open the CSV file to get familiar with the data, which includes various health metrics used for heart disease prediction.

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Launch the Jupyter Notebook to start exploring and running the machine learning model.

```sh
jupyter notebook Classification & Prediction.ipynb
```

Follow the notebook instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies whether a patient has heart disease based on several health metrics.

### Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Model Selection:** Testing different machine learning algorithms to find the best fit.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.
- **Optimization:** Tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.

### Results

For a detailed analysis of the results and insights, refer to the presentation slides.
